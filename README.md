# TwitListed
A Twitter app that will create frequency-based lists for accounts you follow 

Before sharing this on GitHub I had to strip out the consumer_key, consumer_secret, and app.secret_key

To get the program to run you will need to fill in these values first.  Please contact me if you have questions.

(It is my plan to host this as a runnable application online.  I will update the readme with the link once that is available.)
